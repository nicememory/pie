pyglet Documentation
====================

**pyglet** is a cross-platform windowing and multimedia library for Python,
intended for developing games and other visually rich applications. It supports
windowing, user interface event handling, OpenGL graphics, loading images
and videos, and playing sounds and music. **pyglet** works on Windows, OS X
and Linux.

Some of the features of pyglet are:

* **No external dependencies or installation requirements.** For most 
  application and game requirements, pyglet needs nothing else besides Python,
  simplifying distribution and installation.
* **Take advantage of multiple windows and multi-monitor desktops.** pyglet
  allows you to use as many windows as you need, and is fully aware of
  multi-monitor setups for use with fullscreen games and applications.
* **Load images, sound, music and video in almost any format.** pyglet can
  optionally use AVbin to play back audio formats such as MP3, OGG/Vorbis and
  WMA, and video formats such as DivX, MPEG-2, H.264, WMV and Xvid.
* **pyglet is provided under the BSD open-source license**, allowing you to 
  use it for both commercial and other open-source projects with very little
  restriction.
* **Supports Python 2 and 3.** Pick your favorite!
