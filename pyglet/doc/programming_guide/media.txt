Sound and video
===============

pyglet can play many audio and video formats.  Audio is played back with
either OpenAL, DirectSound or Pulseaudio, permitting hardware-accelerated 
mixing and surround-sound 3D positioning.  Video is played into OpenGL 
textures, and so can be easily be manipulated in real-time by applications 
and incorporated into 3D environments.

Decoding of compressed audio and video is provided by `AVbin`_, an optional
component available for Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. AVbin needs to be installed 
separately.

If AVbin is not present, pyglet will fall back to reading uncompressed WAV
files only.  This may be sufficient for many applications that require only a
small number of short sounds, in which case those applications need not
distribute AVbin.

Audio drivers
-------------

pyglet can use OpenAL, DirectSound or Pulseaudio to play back audio.  Only one 
of these drivers can be used in an application, and this must be selected 
before the :py:mod:`pyglet.media` module is loaded.  The available drivers depend on 
your operating system:

    .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        
        * - Windows
          - Mac OS X
          - Linux
        * - OpenAL [#openalf]_
          - OpenAL
          - OpenAL [#openalf]_
        * - DirectSound
          - 
          -
        * -
          - 
          - Pulseaudio

The audio driver can be set through the ``audio`` key of the :py:data:`pyglet.options`
dictionary.  For example::

    pyglet.options['audio'] = ('openal', 'silent')

This tells pyglet to use the OpenAL driver if it is available, and to
ignore all audio output if it is not.  The ``audio`` option can be a list of
any of these strings, giving the preference order for each driver:

    .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1

        * - String
          - Audio driver
        * - ``openal``
          - OpenAL
        * - ``directsound``
          - DirectSound
        * - ``pulse``
          - Pulseaudio
        * - ``silent``
          - No audio output

You must set the ``audio`` option before importing :mod:`pyglet.media`.  You can
alternatively set it through an environment variable; see 
:ref:`guide_environment-settings`.

The following sections describe the requirements and limitations of each audio
driver.

DirectSound
^^^^^^^^^^^

DirectSound is available only on Windows, and is installed by default on
Windows XP and later.  pyglet uses only DirectX 7 features.  On Windows Vista
DirectSound does not support hardware audio mixing or surround sound.

OpenAL
^^^^^^

OpenAL is included with Mac OS X.  Windows users can download a generic driver
from `openal.org`_, or from their sound device's manufacturer.  Linux users can
use the reference implementation also provided by Creative.  For example,
Ubuntu users can ``apt-get install openal``.  ALUT is not required.  pyglet makes use
of OpenAL 1.1 features if available, but will also work with OpenAL 1.0.

Due to a long-standing bug in the reference implementation of OpenAL, stereo
audio is downmixed to mono on Linux.  This does not affect Windows or Mac OS X
users.

Pulse
^^^^^

Pulseaudio has become the standard Linux audio implementation over the past 
few years, and is installed by default with most modern Linux distributions. 

Linux Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Linux users have the option of choosing between OpenAL and Pulse for audio
output.  Unfortunately OpenAL has severe limitations that are outside the 
scope of pyglet's control.

If your application can manage without stereo playback, you should use the 
OpenAL driver (assuming your users have it installed). You can do this with::

    pyglet.options['audio'] = ('openal', 'pulse', 'silent')

If your application needs stereo playback, consider using the Pulse driver 
in preference to the OpenAL driver (this is the default).

.. [#openalf] OpenAL is not installed by default on Windows, nor in many Linux
    distributions.  It can be downloaded separately from your audio device
    manufacturer or `openal.org <http://www.openal.org/downloads.html>`_

Supported media types
---------------------

If AVbin is not installed, only uncompressed RIFF/WAV files encoded with
linear PCM can be read.

With AVbin, many common and less-common formats are supported.  Due to the
large number of combinations of audio and video codecs, options, and container
formats, it is difficult to provide a complete yet useful list.  Some of the
supported audio formats are:

* AU
* MP2
* MP3
* OGG/Vorbis
* WAV
* WMA

Some of the supported video formats are:

* AVI
* DivX
* H.263
* H.264
* MPEG
* MPEG-2
* OGG/Theora
* Xvid
* WMV

For a complete list, see the AVbin sources.  Otherwise, it is probably simpler
to simply try playing back your target file with the ``media_player.py``
example.

New versions of AVbin as they are released may support additional formats, or
fix errors in the current implementation.  AVbin is completely future- and
backward-compatible, so no change to pyglet is needed to use a newer version
of AVbin -- just install it in place of the old version.

Loading media
-------------

Audio and video files are loaded in the same way, using the
:py:func:`pyglet.media.load` function, providing a filename::

    source = pyglet.media.load('explosion.wav')

If the media file is bundled with the application, consider using the resource
module (see :ref:`guide_resources`).

The result of loading a media file is a :py:class:`~pyglet.media.Source` object.  This object provides
useful information about the type of media encoded in the file, and serves as
an opaque object used for playing back the file (described in the next
section).

The :py:func:`~pyglet.media.load` function will raise a :py:class:`~pyglet.media.exceptions.MediaException` if the format is unknown.
`IOError` may also be raised if the file could not be read from disk.  Future
versions of pyglet will also support reading from arbitrary file-like objects,
however a valid filename must currently be given.

The length of the media file is given by the `duration` property, which
returns the media's length in seconds.

Audio metadata is provided in the source's :py:attr:`~pyglet.media.Source.audio_format` attribute, which is
`None` for silent videos.  This metadata is not generally useful to
applications.  See the :py:class:`~pyglet.media.AudioFormat` class documentation for details.  

Video metadata is provided in the source's :py:attr:`~pyglet.media.Source.video_format` attribute, which is
`None` for audio files.  It is recommended that this attribute is checked
before attempting play back a video file -- if a movie file has a readable
audio track but unknown video format it will appear as an audio file.

You can use the video metadata, described in a :py:class:`~pyglet.media.VideoFormat` object, to set up
display of the video before beginning playback.  The attributes are as
follows:

    .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Attribute
          - Description
        * - ``width``, ``height``
          - Width and height of the video image, in pixels.
        * - ``sample_aspect``
          - The aspect ratio of each video pixel.

You must take care to apply the sample aspect ratio to the video image size
for display purposes.  The following code determines the display size for a
given video format::

    def get_video_size(width, height, sample_aspect):
        if sample_aspect > 1.:
            return width * sample_aspect, height
        elif sample_aspect < 1.:
            return width, height / sample_aspect
        else:
            return width, height

Media files are not normally read entirely from disk; instead, they are
streamed into the decoder, and then into the audio buffers and video memory
only when needed.  This reduces the startup time of loading a file and reduces
the memory requirements of the application.

However, there are times when it is desirable to completely decode an audio
file in memory first.  For example, a sound that will be played many times
(such as a bullet or explosion) should only be decoded once.  You can instruct
pyglet to completely decode an audio file into memory at load time::

    explosion = pyglet.media.load('explosion.wav', streaming=False)

The resulting source is an instance of :class:`~pyglet.media.StaticSource`, which provides the same
interface as a streaming source.  You can also construct a :class:`~pyglet.media.StaticSource`
directly from an already-loaded :class:`~pyglet.media.Source`::

    explosion = pyglet.media.StaticSource(pyglet.media.load('explosion.wav'))

Procedural Audio
----------------

In addition to loading audio files from disk, the :py:mod:`pyglet.media.sources.procedural` module is available
for simple audio synthesis. There are a variety of waveforms available:

* :py:class:`~pyglet.media.sources.procedural.Sine`
* :py:class:`~pyglet.media.sources.procedural.Sawtooth`
* :py:class:`~pyglet.media.sources.procedural.Square`
* :py:class:`~pyglet.media.sources.procedural.FM`
* :py:class:`~pyglet.media.sources.procedural.Silence`
* :py:class:`~pyglet.media.sources.procedural.WhiteNoise`
* :py:class:`~pyglet.media.sources.procedural.Digitar`

At a minimum, you will need to specify the duration of the audio you wish to produce. You will also
want to set the frequency (most waveforms will default to 440Hz). Some waveforms, such as the FM
waveform, have additional parameters. More detail can be found in the API documentation for each.

For more vibrant audio, a variety of standard envelopes are available. These envelopes affect the
amplitude (volume), and make for more natural sounding waveforms. You first create an envelope
instance, and then pass it in while creating any of the above waveforms. The same envelope instance
can be passed to any number of waveforms, reducing duplicate code when creating multiple tones.
If no envelope is used, all procedural classes will default to the FlatEnvelope of maximum volume,
which esentially has no effect on the waveform. Check the API documentation of each Envelope
to see which parameters are available.

* :py:class:`~pyglet.media.sources.procedural.FlatEnvelope`
* :py:class:`~pyglet.media.sources.procedural.LinearDecayEnvelope`
* :py:class:`~pyglet.media.sources.procedural.ADSREnvelope`
* :py:class:`~pyglet.media.sources.procedural.TremoloEnvelope`

Simple audio playback
---------------------

Many applications, especially games, need to play sounds in their entirety
without needing to keep track of them.  For example, a sound needs to be
played when the player's space ship explodes, but this sound never needs to
have its volume adjusted, or be rewound, or interrupted.

pyglet provides a simple interface for this kind of use-case.  Call the :meth:`~pyglet.media.Source.play`
method of any :class:`~pyglet.media.Source` to play it immediately and completely::

    explosion = pyglet.media.load('explosion.wav', streaming=False)
    explosion.play()

You can call :py:meth:`~pyglet.media.Source.play` on any
:py:class:`~pyglet.media.Source`, not just
:py:class:`~pyglet.media.StaticSource`.

The return value of :py:meth:`~pyglet.media.Source.play` is a
:py:class:`~pyglet.media.player.Player`, which can either be
discarded, or retained to maintain control over the sound's playback.

Controlling playback
--------------------

You can implement many functions common to a media player using the 
:py:class:`~pyglet.media.player.Player`
class.  Use of this class is also necessary for video playback.  There are no
parameters to its construction::

    player = pyglet.media.Player()

A player will play any source that is "queued" on it.  Any number of sources
can be queued on a single player, but once queued, a source can never be
dequeued (until it is removed automatically once complete).  The main use of
this queuing mechanism is to facilitate "gapless" transitions between playback
of media files.

A :py:class:`~pyglet.media.StreamingSource` can only ever be queued on one player, and only once on
that player.  :py:class:`~pyglet.media.StaticSource` objects can be queued any number of times on any
number of players.  Recall that a :py:class:`~pyglet.media.StaticSource` can be created by passing
``streaming=False`` to the `load` method.

In the following example, two sounds are queued onto a player::

    player.queue(source1)
    player.queue(source2)

Playback begins with the player's :py:meth:`~pyglet.media.Player.play` method is called::

    player.play()

Standard controls for controlling playback are provided by these methods:

    .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Method
          - Description
        * - :py:meth:`~pyglet.media.Player.play`
          - Begin or resume playback of the current source.
        * - :py:meth:`~pyglet.media.Player.pause`
          - Pause playback of the current source.
        * - :py:meth:`~pyglet.media.Player.next_source`
          - Dequeue the current source and move to the next one immediately.
            :py:meth:`~pyglet.media.Player.next` can also be used but it is deprecated because of
            incompatibilities with Python 3.
        * - :py:meth:`~pyglet.media.Player.seek`
          - Seek to a specific time within the current source.

Note that there is no `stop` method.  If you do not need to resume playback,
simply pause playback and discard the player and source objects.  Using the
:meth:`~pyglet.media.Player.next_source` method does not guarantee gapless playback.

There are several properties that describe the player's current state:

    .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1
        
        * - Property
          - Description
        * - :py:attr:`~pyglet.media.Player.time`
          - The current playback position within the current source, in
            seconds.  This is read-only (but see the :py:meth:`~pyglet.media.Player.seek` method).
        * - :py:attr:`~pyglet.media.Player.playing`
          - True if the player is currently playing, False if there are no
            sources queued or the player is paused.  This is read-only (but
            see the :py:meth:`~pyglet.media.Player.pause` and :py:meth:`~pyglet.media.Player.play` methods).
        * - :py:attr:`~pyglet.media.Player.source`
          - A reference to the current source being played.  This is
            read-only (but see the :py:meth:`~pyglet.media.Player.queue` method).
        * - :py:attr:`~pyglet.media.Player.volume`
          - The audio level, expressed as a float from 0 (mute) to 1 (normal
            volume).  This can be set at any time.

When a player reaches the end of the current source, by default it will move
immediately to the next queued source.  If there are no more sources, playback
stops until another is queued.  There are several other possible behaviours,
which can be controlled on :py:class:`~pyglet.media.SourceGroup` objects.

A :class:`~pyglet.media.SourceGroup` contains multiple media sources with the same audio and video 
format. Behaviour on reaching the end of the current source can be controlled
through the :attr:`~pyglet.media.SourceGroup.loop` attribute.

You can change a :py:class:`~pyglet.media.SourceGroup`'s :py:attr:`~pyglet.media.SourceGroup.loop` attribute at any time, 
but be aware that unless sufficient time is given for the future data to be 
decoded and buffered there may be a stutter or gap in playback.  If set well 
in advance of the end of the source (say, several seconds), there will be no 
disruption.

Incorporating video
-------------------

When a :py:class:`~pyglet.media.player.Player` is playing back a source with video, use the :meth:`~pyglet.media.Player.get_texture`
method to obtain the video frame image.  This can be used to display
the current video image syncronised with the audio track, for example::

    @window.event
    def on_draw():
        player.get_texture().blit(0, 0)

The texture is an instance of :class:`pyglet.image.Texture`, with an internal format
of either ``GL_TEXTURE_2D`` or ``GL_TEXTURE_RECTANGLE_ARB``.  While the
texture will typically be created only once and subsequentally updated each
frame, you should make no such assumption in your application -- future
versions of pyglet may use multiple texture objects.

Positional audio
----------------

pyglet uses OpenAL for audio playback, which includes many features for
positioning sound within a 3D space.  This is particularly effective with a
surround-sound setup, but is also applicable to stereo systems.

A :py:class:`~pyglet.media.player.Player` in pyglet has an associated position in 3D space --
that is, it is equivalent to an OpenAL "source".  The properties for setting
these parameters are described in more detail in the API documentation; see
for example :py:attr:`~pyglet.media.Player.position` and :py:attr:`~pyglet.media.Player.pitch`.

The OpenAL "listener" object is provided by the audio driver. To obtain the
listener for the current audio driver::

    pyglet.media.get_audio_driver().get_listener()

This provides similar properties such as
:py:attr:`~pyglet.media.listener.AbstractListener.position`,
:py:attr:`~pyglet.media.listener.AbstractListener.forward_orientation` and
:py:attr:`~pyglet.media.listener.AbstractListener.up_orientation` that describe the 
position of the user in 3D space.

Note that only mono sounds can be positioned.  Stereo sounds will play back as
normal, and only their volume and pitch properties will affect the sound.
